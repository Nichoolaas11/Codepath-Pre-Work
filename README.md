## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
The only resource necessary for completing the game was the tutorial provided. I did however have some issues creating the gifs and I had to quickly review some online forums to do so.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
The only problem I encountered was with the creation of the gifs. The suggested resources for creating the gifs of the game didn't work for me so I had to quickly research how to screen record and convert a file from mp4 to gif, which ended up being an easy task. Besides that, although I have no prior experience with the languages we used, the tutorial was sufficient in aiding me through the game construction.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
Before completing this small project, I had no prior knowledge on how web development was done, and I often wondered how you coding related to websites. It didn't make a lot of sense to me. After completing this game now I understand the basics of it and am impressed on the process of constructing websites or apps through github. A question I have about web development is, in the scope of a larger project how would the development of a website/application be divided in a team? Since there are many variants in creating such, I imagine the distribution of tasks is necessary for efficiency.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
In my opinion the game we were tasked to build is one that stands out because of its simplicity and playability. It wouldn't make a lot of sense to me to alter rules of the game or to try to somehow make it more challenging. I believe the best thing to do to improve the game would be to drastically improve the design of it. By making the game more aesthetically pleasing with better visuals and sounds, the user would have a more pleasant experience and the simplicity of the game would be kept. As it is the game looks very primitive in design and surely not many people would play it for a long time, but with nicer designs in the background and more intricate art, longer playtime could be more easily attainable.
